Remi Monoco, Executive Assistant
The Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance
457 Madison Avenue
New York, NY 10022

Dear Mr. Monoco:
I am applying for the position of Office Associate with the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance
(MWA) based on the recommendation of a mutual friend, Kim Power. I will graduate in May
2016 from the University of Virginia (U.Va.) with a Bachelor of Urban and Environmental Planning, a
Bachelor of Arts in French and a minor in Architecture. I will be moving to New York City soon and see
this position as the ideal opportunity to contribute the skills I have gained from my professional
experience, academic studies, and diverse background. I share the belief with MWA that waterfront
areas should be accessible for all, and I am strongly motivated to make the New York and New Jersey
shores a pleasant place to live, work and play.

My organizational and communication skills are well demonstrated in my work experiences in nonprofit,
corporate and student organization settings. Currently, I intern with Piedmont Council of the Arts
which shares similar responsibilities to the position at MWA. During my internship, I provide
administrative support, focusing on maintaining a contact database of local artists, creating a new filing
system for the council and constructing e-mail campaigns. I have also interned at KPMG Audit Form, a
corporate environment where attention to detail was essential when managing client files and
proofreading financial statements. In addition, I handled event logistics and publicized events when I
served as publicity chair of the Taiwanese Student Association at U.Va. I have acquired a sophisticated
understanding of urban affairs through my studies. My coursework included site assessment and data
collection, application of planning regulations, and the development of recommendations in order to
create neighborhood master plan and transportation plan. Originally from Taiwan, my residence in
Germany, France and the United States, as well as my extensive travel experience have fostered
an ease in working with people from diverse backgrounds.

Kim Power is sending you a letter in regards to my qualifications and I look forward to
discussing my candidacy for this position with you as well. Thank you for your time and thoughtful
consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon.

Respectfully,

Anna (Thi) Pan
